# lemmeknow-frontend

A website made for [lemmeknow](https://github.com/swanandx/lemmeknow) using Yew. 

Check it out [here](https://swanandx.github.io/lemmeknow-frontend/)

# How to build?

We use [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) for building our application.

Clone the repository and use `trunk serve` to view it locally.

# How it works?

The frontend is made using Yew. We use [lemmeknow](https://github.com/swanandx/lemmeknow) as a dependecy.
lemmeknow supports webassembly! So it just works right out of the box when called from Yew.

This is how we do #FullStackRust ;)
